Pitch Recognition Trainer
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Piano Ear Trainer is designed to be a fun tool to help users improve their sense of pitch. At the press of a button a user is played a random piano note. A user can then input their guess of where on the piano that note came from. Alternatively the aspiring musician can also improve their sheet music reading skills by generating a random note on the staff. The app keeps track of the users score and displays this as a percentage in a scss graphic dial.
